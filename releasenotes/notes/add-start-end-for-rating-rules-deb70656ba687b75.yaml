features:
  - |
    Add new fields to specify the validity period of rating rules for modules
    ``hashmap`` and ``pyscripts``. These new fields also improve the audit
    mechanism for rating rules changes and deletion, allowing users to know
    when the rules were changed or removed (marked as deleted) and by whom.

upgrade:
  - |
    New rules for both ``hashmap`` and ``pyscript`` modules will no longer be
    reprocessed for past periods, by default they are valid from the moment
    they were created on. To allow new rules to be valid for past periods,
    operators will need to specify a ``start_date`` in the past and pass the
    query parameter ``force=true`` when creating the rating rule, then the
    rule will be valid and used since the defined start date. Update rating
    rules for both ``hashmap`` and ``pyscript`` modules will no longer be
    allowed for rules where the ``start_date`` is in the past, to do so, you
    will need to delete and create a new rating rule with the desired values,
    the unique value you can update for rules that already started, is the
    ``end_date``.
