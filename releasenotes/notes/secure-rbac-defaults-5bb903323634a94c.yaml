upgrade:
  - |
    All the policies implement the ``scope_type`` and new defaults.

    * **Scope**

      Each policy is protected with ``project`` ``scope_type``.

    * **New Defaults (Admin, Member and Reader)**

      Policies are default to Admin, Member and Reader roles. Old roles are
      also supported. There is no change in the legacy admin access.
