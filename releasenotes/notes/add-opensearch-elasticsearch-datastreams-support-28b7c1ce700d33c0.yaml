    Adds support to the OpenSearch and Elasticsearch v2 storage backends for
    using datastreams, rather than indices. These are useful when a cluster
    has multiple storage types, as data can be rotated from hot to cold storage
    when not in active use. The option ``use_datastream`` can be set under
    either ``[storage_elasticsearch]`` or ``[storage_opensearch]``.
